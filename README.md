# Chuck Norris - Web Assembly plugins

Goal: try to see what it would be like to have a plugin system
using webassembly.

`wa_chuck_norris` is written in Python but should be able to load plugins written in any language (at least Python, JavaScript and Rust), each plugin
providing its very own Chuck Norris fact.
